# Zirv Flow

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Zirv Flow is a self-hosted marketing automation tool written in Rust. Marketers
connect internal and external data sources, segment the people in their business
from that data, and run automation flows for everyone or for a segment.

## Focus areas

- **Segmentation** -- define and maintain segments of people from the data you
  connect.
- **Data sources** -- bring internal and external data into one place.
- **Integrations** -- reach people and systems through the channels and tools
  you already use.

## Status

Pre-alpha. The project is at the architecture and roadmap stage and the crate is
a skeleton: nothing is ready to use yet.

- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md)
- [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md)

## Development

Install the stable Rust toolchain and [cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st), then:

```sh
cargo build
```

Before opening a PR, run the four gates:

```sh
cargo build
cargo nextest run --no-fail-fast
cargo fmt -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```
